<h1>Call for papers</h1>

<p>
  The goal of the workshop is to foster discussions and collaborations among researchers from various domains related to secure Identity Management.
  The contributed talks committee invites talk proposals to be considered for presentation at the workshop.
  Submissions can describe current research results addressing secure and usable IdM, including cryptographic schemes and techniques, analytical results, work on systems, and position papers.
  We also highly welcome submissions from practitioners providing insights into current deployment and usability challenges.
  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy challenges &amp; privacy-enhancing IdM solutions</li>
<li>Novel cryptographic schemes and protocols for IdM</li>
<li>Biometric and behavioural authentication</li>
<li>Systems implementing new IdM approaches</li>
<li>Implementation and deployment challenges</li>
<li>Analysis of deployed IdM solutions</li>
<li>Usability studies</li>
<li>Techniques for improving the usability of IdM solutions</li>
<li>Social and political aspects of IdM</li>
</ul>
<p>
As this workshop will not be accompanied by published proceedings, we accept contributed talk proposals which correspond to papers that are under submission or already published elsewhere.
